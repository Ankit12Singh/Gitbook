# Multiple Linear Regression with R

## Prompt

Dr. Sam Parameter, author of the textbook Statistics for Poets, has been contemplating starting a new magazine, Popular Statistics, and needs to know if it will be profitable enough. You have augmented the original dataset of 50 magazines by measuring more characteristics of the magazines and their predictors that may be useful in understanding the one-page advertisement costs better. The variables are the following :

```text
Magazine Name
Cost of a four-color, one-page ad
Circulation  (projected, in thousands)
Percent male among the predicted readership
Median household income of readership
Market = Sold in USA or outside USA 
```

Your goal is to analyze the data with R using Multiple Linear Regression methods and choose the best model to explain the differences in advertising costs between the different titles and then to predict what Sam should be able to charge for the advertisements in the new magazine.

## Steps
### Data Preparation
'''r
mag_data <- read.csv("MagazineAds.csv")
sum(is.na(mag_data))
#import data
head(mag_data)
str(mag_data)
domestic <- as.numeric(as.numeric(mag_data$Market)==1)
#create a new dummy variable to describe Market variable
mag_data1 <- mag_data[,c(-1,-6)]
#remove the col with magazine name and the Market columns
mag_data1$domestic <- domestic
#add the dummy varible into the data frame
'''
### Data Exploration
##### Histogram

The skewness is noticeable in three variables Median Income, One Ad Page Cost, and Circulation. Theyâ€™re skewed right, with long tail and the peak of the histogram veers to the left. There seems to be more magazines with one ad page cost lower than the average of one ad page cost for all magazines. Same seems to be true for median income and circulation. There are more magazines with lower circulations and lower median income of reader.
