# Multiple Linear Regression with R

## Prompt

Dr. Sam Parameter, author of the textbook Statistics for Poets, has been contemplating starting a new magazine, Popular Statistics, and needs to know if it will be profitable enough. You have augmented the original dataset of 50 magazines by measuring more characteristics of the magazines and their predictors that may be useful in understanding the one-page advertisement costs better. The variables are the following :

```text
Magazine Name
Cost of a four-color, one-page ad
Circulation  (projected, in thousands)
Percent male among the predicted readership
Median household income of readership
Market = Sold in USA or outside USA 
```

Your goal is to analyze the data with R using Multiple Linear Regression methods and choose the best model to explain the differences in advertising costs between the different titles and then to predict what Sam should be able to charge for the advertisements in the new magazine.
