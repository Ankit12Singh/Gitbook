### Prompt

Dr. Sam Parameter, author of the textbook Statistics for Poets, has been contemplating starting a new magazine, Popular Statistics, and needs to know if it will be profitable enough. You have augmented the original dataset of 50 magazines by measuring more characteristics of the magazines and their predictors that may be useful in understanding the one-page advertisement costs better. The variables are the following :

```text
Magazine Name
Cost of a four-color, one-page ad
Circulation  (projected, in thousands)
Percent male among the predicted readership
Median household income of readership
Market = Sold in USA or outside USA
```

Your goal is to analyze the data with R using Multiple Linear Regression methods and choose the best model to explain the differences in advertising costs between the different titles and then to predict what Sam should be able to charge for the advertisements in the new magazine.

### Steps

#### Data Preparation

```r
> mag_data <- read.csv("MagazineAds.csv")
> #Import data 
> sum(is.na(mag_data))
> #Check missing values
> head(mag_data)

                    C1.T pagecost  circ percmale medianincome   Market
1                Audubon    25315  1645     51.1        38787 Domestic
2 Better Homes & Gardens   198000 34797     22.1        41933 Domestic
3          Business Week   103300  4760     68.1        63667 Domestic
4           Cosmopolitan    94100 15452     17.3        44237 Domestic
5                   Elle    55540  3735     12.5        47211 Domestic
6           Entrepreneur    40355  2476     60.4        47579 Domestic
```
We need to transform Market Variable into a dummy varible
```r
> mag_data$domestic <- as.numeric(as.numeric(mag_data$Market)==1)
> #create a new dummy variable (domestic) to describe Market variable
> mag_data1 <- mag_data[,c(-1,-6)]
> #remove the  magazine name and the market columns
```

#### Data Exploration

**Histogram**

The skewness is noticeable in three variables Median Income, One Ad Page Cost, and Circulation. Theyâ€™re skewed right, with long tail and the peak of the histogram veers to the left. There seems to be more magazines with one ad page cost lower than the average of one ad page cost for all magazines. Same seems to be true for median income and circulation. There are more magazines with lower circulations and lower median income of reader.
