# Time Series Forecast

## Forecasting Average Seed Fund Size for Startups in the US

We were allowed to pick the subject and data set of our interest, and I managed to convinced Henry to analyze seed fund in the US since tech startup always has my highest level of interest.

### Problem Statement 
Working capital is a critical problem for every startup. Starting a company is always an expensive venture, and most founders do not have the means to bootstrap or solely fund initial startup activities. At early stage, a common external funding type is seed capital, which is a type of equity-based funding in which an investor invests capital into a business during its early stages in exchange for equity stake.
We notice an increase in the investment size for a funding deal, and we are sure founders care about the investment capacity of the market. Therefore, we decide to analyze the changes in the average seeding fund size for a startup in the US.

Our objective is to build a model that can best forecast this number

### Our data
Our data source is Crunchbase.com, a website that crowd sources information about the fundraising of many startups around the world. Unfortunately, one had to pay a Pro membership to download the most recent data from Crunchbase. Therefore, we decided to use the data from 2006 to 2015, which is not up to date but can serve to train our models. We avoid using data for before 2006 period due to low quality and unstable data structure. We also notice this data set is biased and probably missing observation information, but we try to fit the best model and will reconsider its applicability for future data set.

Our data set has 22,791 observations from 2006 to 2015. We take the average of funding amount for each quarter and come up with the final data set for building models, which has 40 rows (40 quarters). Our response variable is “Average Fund”. Our training set includes the first 36 quarters, and our testing set includes our last 4 quarters.
Explanatory variables include several economics indicators, which we adapt from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis’s data.

### Our Model Prediction Performance 
|    Models                                        |    RMSE        |    MAPE     |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------|
|    Holt-Winter’s Smoothing                       |    188,027     |    15.2%    |
|    Time Series Regression with Quadratic Time    |    132,364     |    11.6%    |
|    Regression Against Economic Indicators        |    153,345     |    13.7%    |
|    ARIMA                                         |    171,804     |    15.1%    |

Of all models we tried, Time Series Regression with Quadratic Time has the lowest RMSE and MAPE. This model also shows the best performance on testing set with MAPE of 14%. From our models we can see that the average seed stage investment into startup companies are steadily increasing over time. The average early stage investment fund for startups are seeing an upward trend with small degrees of fluctuation. However, from our fitted models there are no strong quarterly seasonality effect on the amount funded. 

### Consideration
We’re aware of the unsystematic nature of this data set. However, it is our high interest to see the trend and changes in seed fund size in the US. Fluctuations in the data may be caused by other variables that we were not able to capture. 
We had to limit our number of observations since data has multiple missing values and some extreme outliers. But using the models that we created, it is shown that startups looking for early stage fundraising do not need to time the market for the best entering date.
Besides, we also notice that with 35 observations in our training set, the ARIMA model may not show the optimal result.

### Steps
#### Data Preparation
In this class, we tried to use Excel as much as possible. When it comes to the function that Excel inherently does not provide, we use R.
