# Scrape Glassdoor Reviews - Python

We felt the need to analyze the employee reviews on Glassdoor because it unlocks insights about current employees, so I wrote this python codes to scrape all reviews for The Wonderful Company and its competitor. I am not sure if this go against the Glassdoor's terms of use, so please be conscious if you would like to do the same thing. Besides, this code works for the current layout and url structure of Glassdoor website.

 Any change or update to the website can render my codes useless, and you have to then adjust the code accordingly.
